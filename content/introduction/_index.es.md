### Introduction

# Using R for data journalism

This course is designed to give you a sense of all the possibilities from programming in R. 

It'll emphasize packages that will help you do data analysis and visualization. 

Once you see how fun and easy it can be, you'll be more open to tackling the more challenging task of robust statistical analysis in R, with all its quirks. 

I'll be sure to include links and suggestions for ways to build on top of what you'll learn in this course.
