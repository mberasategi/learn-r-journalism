### Chapter 6

# Publishing


Reproducible research means structuring your project and code so that others can follow your steps to verify your findings and possibly build on your work.

We're going to learn how to move our scripts into R Markdown, which will allow you to weave a narrative of text around your code and visualizations. Imagine being able to communicate your findings as well as your thought process with your editor or members of your team.


### Show your work

**Everyone's doing it!**

For journalists, publishing your methodology and allowing others to start with raw data, transform it, and end up with your results themselves helps you:

* Build trust among readers
* Enhance transparency
* Promote community

Do this enough and you'll be able to read and interpret others' methodology. 

This is a great way to learn new techniques and make you think about how to apply them to future stories.

Finally, the person who will benefit from documenting and scripting your process the most in the future is you.

R won't help make you a faster data analyst. 

The process you document for the data projects you agonize over today will make your life easier in the future. 

You're collecting enough scripts, whether your own or others, that you can apply to challenging stories in the future.
