      <description>Syntax You must follow pretty specific syntax rules for it to work. R won’t guess for you.
  R is case-sensitive (unlike SQL) intepreted language (unlike C) Can enter commands at prompt &amp;gt; or in batch Comments are preceded by #  This is important to use often in your code for documentation You’ll see it often in this course  Statements are lines of code such as functions and object assignments  Enters in code (as in a new line) or semi-colons will separate statements    Working directories Your working directory is the folder on your computer in which you are currently working.</description>
