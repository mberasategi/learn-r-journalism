      <description>Let’s create a locator map like you would when searching for an address on Google Maps.
Sometimes it’s necessary to zoom in or pan around a map for greater comprehension while exploring data spatially.
The Leaflet R package was created by the folks behind RStudio to integrate with the popular opensource JavaScript library.
It’s great for journalists who have little knowledge of JavaScript who want to make interesting interactives using R.</description>
