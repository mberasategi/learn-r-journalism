      <description>Let’s bring that data back in again.
library(readr) ages &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;data/ages.csv&amp;quot;) Remember that Dot Plot we made before?
library(ggplot2) ggplot(ages, aes(x=actress_age, y=Movie)) + geom_point() It’s not that great, right? It’s in reverse alphabetical order.
Let’s reorder it based on age.
Reordering chart labels This means we need to transform the data.
The easiest way to do this is with the package forcats, which (surprise!) is also part of the tidyverse universe.</description>

      <description>We’re going to go over some examples of visualizations created with packages that people have created to build on top of ggplot2. People love improving and building upon things. The latest version of ggplot2 was released recently and more than 300 people contributed– either by adding pieces from their add-on packages or by suggesting fixes.
gghighlight The gghighlight package is a relatively new addition. In the previous section, I showed a way to surface important data while keeping the background data for context.</description>
