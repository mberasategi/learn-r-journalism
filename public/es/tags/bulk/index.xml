      <description>Have you ever dealt with a large folder of spreadsheets that you need to combine into one?
With spreadsheets, you have to copy and paste over and over again.
But with R, you can script that process.
In fact, Iâ€™ve created a function for you that simplifies the process.
You have to download my muckrakr package off of GitHub with the devtools package.
# If you don&amp;#39;t have devtools installed yet, uncomment and run the line below #install.</description>
